      1. liability notice
      <br />
      The contents have been researched with the utmost care. Nevertheless, the authors do not guarantee the timeliness, accuracy, completeness or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the authors, which refer to damages of material or immaterial nature caused by use or disuse of the information or the use of incorrect or incomplete information are excluded, unless the authors are not intentional or grossly negligent fault. All offers are subject to change and non-binding. The authors expressly reserve the right to change, supplement, delete or temporarily or permanently cease publication of parts of the pages or the entire offer without prior notice.

      2. references and links
      <br />
      In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites ("links"), which lie outside the area of responsibility of the authors, a liability obligation would only come into force in the event that the authors have knowledge of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for them to prevent use in the event of illegal content. The authors therefore expressly declare that the linked pages were free of illegal content at the time the links were created. The authors have no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. Therefore, they hereby expressly distance themselves from all contents of all linked pages that were changed after the link was set. This statement applies to all links and references set within the own internet offer as well as to external entries in guest books, discussion forums and mailing lists set up by the authors. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages resulting from the use or non-use of such information, only the provider of the page to which reference was made, and not the one who has linked to the respective publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. copyright and trademark law
      <br />
      The authors strive to observe the copyrights of the graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts used in all publications, to use graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts created by themselves or to use license-free graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts. All brand names and trademarks mentioned on the website and possibly protected by third parties are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered owners. The mere mention of a trademark does not imply that it is not protected by the rights of third parties! The copyright for published objects created by the authors themselves remains solely with the authors of the pages. Any duplication or use of objects such as diagrams, sounds or texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the authors' agreement.
